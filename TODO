TODOs:
- add tags to workout documents to make them searchable
- provide view for when workout is not present for a given day
- perform tests to see exactly how often the app is reading from the database
- cache firestore queries so that fragment ui loads immediately / reload fragment with previous state?
- sort workouts alphabetically by workout type
- Add tabs for other activities
- create gym news section
- create schedule section
- Create Auth flow
    - sign in
    - sign out

Nice to haves:
- sliding motion between fragments instead of fading
- only allow one box to be expanded at a time

Release Tests:
- upon release see if Workout class variables need to be public for Firebase toObject
