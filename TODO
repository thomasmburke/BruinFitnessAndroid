TODOs:
- without listening on older documents they don't get populated
    - would be nice to cache results on device and try and reload their first
- Set workout listener timezone to timezone of the gym or UTC
Enhance workout data:
    - workout memories. show users how they did the last time they did this workouts
    - store user's PRs and remind them on a yearly basis
    - ability for users to star / heart workouts 
        - allows for tracking of what workouts users liked
        - maybe allow users to store favorite workouts
    - add tags to workout documents to make them searchable
- perform tests to see exactly how often the app is reading from the database
- create gym news section
- insert_graph or pie_chart icon for tab if stats page is built
- Create another Auth flow
        - email link authentication
            - This would require a Bruin Fitness webpage that tells users to click the link on their mobile device
            - The membership signup email link should ideally be included in their gym registration email with context of what the link does
            - Web will not have a sign in/out

Nice to haves:
- looks like I built something that already exists: https://github.com/firebase/FirebaseUI-Android/blob/master/firestore/README.md
- provide view for when workout is not present for a given day
- sliding motion between fragments instead of fading
- only allow one box to be expanded at a time
- for schedule select a city (v0.0.0 will only have one location)
- email link verification
- https://gist.github.com/gabrielemariotti/4c189fb1124df4556058 to have headers stick in schedule fragment

Release Tests:
