TODOs:
Enhance workout data:
    - ability for users to star / heart workouts 
        - allows for tracking of what workouts users liked
        - maybe allow users to store favorite workouts
    - add tags to workout documents to make them searchable
- perform tests to see exactly how often the app is reading from the database
- sort workouts alphabetically by workout type
- create gym news section
- create schedule section
- Create Auth flow
    - sign in
    - sign out

Nice to haves:
- provide view for when workout is not present for a given day
- sliding motion between fragments instead of fading
- only allow one box to be expanded at a time

Release Tests:
- upon release see if Workout class variables need to be public for Firebase toObject
