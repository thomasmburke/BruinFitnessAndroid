TODOs:
- cache firestore queries so that fragment ui loads immediately / reload fragment with previous state?
- sort workouts alphabetically by workout type
- only allow one box to be expanded at a time
- Add tabs for other activities
- create gym news section
- Add Loading screen for when querying Firestore on the main activity
- Create Auth flow
    - sign in
    - sign out

Nice to haves:
- sliding motion between fragments instead of fading

Release Tests:
- upon release see if Workout class variables need to be public for Firebase toObject

On Load:
Query All two weeks of workouts
write each day workouts to a dictionary
set recycler view to look at the current days HashMap
